    <h1 class="h1">Syracuse Rising</h1>
    <h2 class="h2">How an influx of city-dwellers is revitalizing America's downtowns</h2>

    <p class="byline">By <span>Chris Voll</span></p>

    <div class="text-block">
      <p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="lede">ver the past</span> five years, the oft-repeated narrative of the struggling rust belt city center has eroded away. Stories of vacant buildings, rising crime, and gritty perseverance have been replaced by those of gentrification, investment, and prosperity. Syracuse, once a city afraid of change, has begun to embrace luxury apartments, coffee shops, and other symbols of progressive reinvention that have characterized the growth of other more liveable cities.</p>

      <p>According to a Syracuse.com article on the trend, "Downtown's population has increased 47 percent in the last decade and 21 percent in the last three years alone." Since 2012, more than 900 new housing units downtown have been constructed or are currently being planned.</p>

      <p>The Syracuse Downtown Committee in 2014 released a report outlining nearly $2.6 billion (actual numbers now are closer to $2.8 billion) of capital that has recently been or soon will be invested in Syracuse-area construction projects. These new developments, centered around University Hill, Armory Square, the Inner Harbor, and Loguen Crossing, reflect greater demand for housing within the city.</p>

      <h3 class="h3">Where is the $2.8 billion going?</h3>

      <p>Interestingly, despite the large housing boom in downtown Syracuse, only a small share of the total amount invested has been in residential properties. However, it is important to note that large projects like Destiny USA ($540 million), Inner Harbor ($350 million) and Loguen Crossing ($340 million) skew these numbers.

      <h3 class="h3">Which neighborhoods are benefitting the most?</h3>

      <p>The Lakefront neighborhood is home to both the Destiny USA regional shopping center and the Inner Harbor mixed-use development, which combine to over $1 billion in investment from private developers. University Hill and Downtown are characterized by many smaller building projects on the SU, ESF and Upstate campuses.</p>

      <h3 class="h3">How does Syracuse compare?</h3>

      <p>While capital investments are difficult to compare amongst different regions, the economic stability of Syracuse can be viewed through the proxy of its poverty levels. Compared to most of the Northeast and Midwest, Onondaga's poverty level of 9.6% is is about average, if not slightly high.</p>
